# Front-end Development Style Guide

Hello my friends, I write this style guide document for standard coding in front-end development. This is not the guideline for all front-end development and is not the rules defined by W3. The whole guide is written to standardize and clean coding to be readable for another developers based on my experience and research.  
_Actually, this is for my coworkers and friends._

## Basic Structure
Use simple directory structure. Don't put files here and there.

**Do**

**Don't**
