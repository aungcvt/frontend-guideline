# Front-end Development Style Guide

Hello my friends, I write this style guide document for standard coding in front-end development. This is not the guideline for all front-end development and this is not the rules defined by W3. The whole guide is written to standardize and clean coding to be readable for another developers based on my experience and my research.

## Basic Structure
Use simple directory structure. Don't put files here and there.

**Do**
````
index.html
assets
  css
  js
  img
  fonts
````

**Don't**
````
index.html
style.css
app.js
logo.png
````
