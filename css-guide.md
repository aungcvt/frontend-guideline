# Naming

## Class name
Class name must be in all small letters. Don't use capitalize for class names.
e.g. class="abc defghi"
Not: class="Abc Defghi"

Class name cannot start with numbers and special characters.
e.g. Not: class="1abc $abc"

Long class names can be divided by "-" dash ( minus ). Don't use underscore ( _ ) for class name dividers.
e.g. class="abc-def col-sm-3"
Not: class="abc_def col_sm_3"

## Id
Long id should use underscore ( _ ) to divide. Don't use dash ( - ) for id.
( This is the way to differentiate between class and id. )
e.g. id="abc_def"
Not: id="abc-def"
